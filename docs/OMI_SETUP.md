https://f10aa97dd357.ngrok-free.app/

Auth URL:
https://f10aa97dd357.ngrok-free.app/auth

## 🎯 Trigger Phrases (ONLY these 3)

1. **"Send Slack message"**
   - Example: "Send Slack message to general saying hello team"

2. **"Post Slack message"**
   - Example: "Post Slack message in marketing that campaign is live"

3. **"Post in Slack"**
   - Example: "Post in Slack to random saying great idea"

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

### **Segment Collection:**
- **Max:** 5 segments (including trigger)
- **Timeout:** 5 seconds of silence → processes immediately
- **Minimum:** 2 segments (trigger + content)

### **Channel Detection:**
- Automatically fetches fresh channels every time
- New channels work immediately (no refresh needed!)
- AI fuzzy matches spoken names to workspace channels
- Falls back to default channel if no match

### **Example Flow:**

```
You: "Send Slack message to general saying quick update"
     [Segment 1 - collecting...]
     
You: "the new feature is ready to launch"
     [Segment 2 - collecting...]
     
     [5+ second pause detected]
     
     → Processing 2 segments...
     → Channel: #general (auto-fetched)
     → Message: "Quick update, the new feature is ready to launch."
     → ✅ Sent!
```

## 🚀 Features

### ✨ **Smart Features:**
- **Auto-refresh channels** - Always up-to-date, no manual refresh
- **Fuzzy channel matching** - AI matches imperfect pronunciations
- **5-second timeout** - Process early if you pause
- **Max 5 segments** - Prevents runaway collection
- **Switch workspace** - Easy multi-workspace support
- **chat:write.public** - Post to public channels without joining

### 🎤 **Voice Examples:**

**Quick message (2 segments + timeout):**
```
"Send Slack message to general saying hello"
[pause 5 seconds]
→ Sends immediately
```

**Longer message (up to 5 segments):**
```
"Post Slack message in marketing that the new campaign is live"
[continue speaking...]
"and all the materials are ready to go"
[continue speaking...]
"team did an amazing job on this"
→ Collects all 5 segments then sends
```

3. **5-second timeout** - Adaptive collection
4. **Max 5 segments** - Longer messages supported
5. **Workspace switching** - Multi-workspace support

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### **Keep Both Running:**
- ✅ Python app: `python main.py`
- ✅ ngrok: `ngrok http 8000`

### **ngrok URL Changes:**
- Free ngrok URLs change on restart
- Update OMI app URLs if you restart ngrok
- For permanent URL, use Railway deployment

### **Public Channels Only:**
For private channels, bot still needs to be invited manually (Slack security requirement)
